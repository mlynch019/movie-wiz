# Welcome to Movie Genie!
Movie Genie is a web-based large langauge model (LLM) that recommends a movie to a user after a series of generated questions. With use of OpenAI and LangChain documentation, the app utilizes 3 LLM's: an initial model to generate questions to ask the user, a second model to summarize the recorded conversation history, and a third that works in conjunction with a movie database to provide a final movie recomendation to the user.
